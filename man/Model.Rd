\title{Pretrained prediction model}
\usage{
Model(name, description, disease, doi = "", fun)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{A scalar character string giving the unique model identifier.}

\item{description}{A scalar character string describing the biological task
and purpose of the model.}

\item{disease}{A scalar character string indicating the disease context the
model was trained for.}

\item{doi}{A scalar character string giving the DOI of the associated
publication, if available.}

\item{fun}{A function implementing the model prediction logic. The function
must accept at least a \code{data} argument containing the required model inputs.}
}
\description{
An S7 class representing a pretrained SigScore model used to predict
mechanistic dysfunctions in cancer cells from genomic and transcriptomic
features. \code{Model} objects provide a unified interface to all SigScore models
and encapsulate both metadata and the prediction function.
}
\details{
The prediction function stored in \code{fun} is expected to operate on a named
list or similar structure matching the model specification. Validation is
performed at construction time to ensure the required interface is present.
}
\section{Constructor}{

\code{Model(name, description, disease, doi = "", fun)} creates a new pretrained
model object.
